Project Description: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes the Heart Disease Dataset, which contains various medical features related to heart health. Several classification models are trained and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression: A fundamental statistical model for binary classification tasks.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm for creating optimal hyperplanes to separate data points into classes.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm classifying data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.
Decision Tree: A tree-based model making decisions based on a series of feature-based splits.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.
The project involves the following steps:

Data Acquisition: Obtaining the Heart Disease Dataset.
Data Exploration: Analyzing data characteristics, distributions, and correlations using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Data Preprocessing: Preparing data for model training by handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training the selected classification algorithms using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Comparison: Comparing the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for heart disease prediction.
Results:

The project compares the accuracy and other relevant metrics of each algorithm on the test data. It highlights the best-performing model and discusses its strengths and limitations.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction. The findings can potentially assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.
